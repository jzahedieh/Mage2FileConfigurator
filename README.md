# Magento 2 File Configurator

**File Configurator** provides the ability to define configuration in file format (YAML) and apply to Magento system config.

The goal of this module is to provide an easy way to keep Magento configured between developers machines and deployment environments.

I am treating this as a learning exercise for Magento 2 development, hopefully something useful will come out of it.

*This is WIP, I would not recommend it in the current state*
